I have an existing personal portfolio website built with [React / HTML-CSS-JS / Next.js / Vue / Svelte â€“ specify yours]. I want you to completely reimagine and transform it into a modern, visually captivating experience that looks and feels like a designer/developer hybrid dream site.

Please implement **advanced, smooth, and performance-friendly animations** throughout every component, page, and interaction, using a combination of modern animation libraries and techniques. The goal is to create an immersive, interactive DevOps/Tech Portfolio that stands out with polish and creativity, while remaining professional and lightweight.

ðŸ”® **Core Goals**:
- Make everything feel ALIVE: buttons, cards, page transitions, navigation, tooltips, icons, backgrounds.
- Apply micro-interactions for clicks, hovers, scrolls, and gestures.
- Ensure all animations are fluid, snappy, and optimized for performance.

---

ðŸ§° **Use These Modern Animation Libraries** *(based on the tech stack used)*:

1. **Framer Motion** *(for React/Next.js)*  
   - Page transitions: fade, slide, scale, cover, shared layout animations  
   - Staggered children, drag gestures, layout shifts, entrance animations

2. **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**  
   - Timeline-based animations, scroll-triggered effects, morphing, infinite loops  
   - Text animation, parallax layers, SVG path drawing

3. **ScrollTrigger / Locomotive Scroll / Lenis**  
   - Smooth scrolling, scroll-based reveals, pinned sections, parallax  

4. **Anime.js** *(for general JS apps)*  
   - Fine-grained control over motion: easing curves, timing, physics  
   - Great for animating SVGs, charts, paths, and elements in sync  

5. **Lottie (via lottie-web or react-lottie)**  
   - Lightweight JSON-based animations for icons, loaders, transitions

6. **Three.js + GSAP** *(optional 3D elements)*  
   - Add interactive 3D backgrounds or objects with hover/scroll effects

7. **Typed.js / Splitting.js**  
   - Animate text reveal, letter-by-letter effects, typewriter feel

ðŸŒ€ **Implement the Following Animation Types (Where Applicable)**:

- **Hover & Press Effects**  
  - Button glows, ripple effects, border morph, color transitions  
  - Card tilt, scale-in-out, floating shadows

- **Scroll-based Animations**  
  - Section fade/slide-ins, parallax background/image effects  
  - Animate as sections enter the viewport (Reveal-on-scroll)

- **Navigation & Page Transitions**  
  - Smooth route transitions (fade, slide, push-in, zoom)  
  - Animated hamburger menu toggle, mobile nav slide-down

- **Text Animations**  
  - Per-letter animation, word staggering, scroll-based reveal  
  - Dynamic counters, rotating headlines

- **Interactive Elements**  
  - Tooltip reveals, interactive 3D cards or icons  
  - Hover-to-expand sections, draggable cards, bouncing effects

- **Loaders & Preloaders**  
  - Use Lottie or CSS loaders  
  - Animate loading bar or preloader animation before homepage loads

- **Theme Transitions**  
  - Animate dark/light toggle with smooth fade/motion  
  - Preserve state during transitions

ðŸŽ¨ **Design Guidance (Optional)**:
- Use soft gradients, glassmorphism, or frosted UI  
- Follow modern UI systems (Material, Neumorphism, Fluent UI)  
- Adopt a soothing tech-oriented color scheme (e.g. Catppuccin, Nord, Tokyo Night)  
- High-contrast, legible fonts (e.g. Inter, Poppins, Satoshi, DM Sans)  

---

ðŸ“± **Make it Fully Responsive & Performance-Oriented**:
- Optimize animations for 60fps; use `will-change`, avoid layout thrashing  
- Ensure mobile compatibility with gesture-based interactions  
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to respect user preferences

---

ðŸ”§ **Additional Details**:
- Modular, component-driven code structure  
- Animate using keyframes or library hooks as appropriate  
- Prioritize user experienceâ€”animations should enhance, not distract  
- Ensure accessibility: animations should not hinder readability or usability

---

ðŸ”¥ Outcome:
A high-end, fully animated, portfolio site that feels like a blend of **[animejs.com](https://animejs.com/)**, **Apple product pages**, and **a creative devâ€™s playground**. It should impress recruiters and developers alikeâ€”showcasing attention to design, smooth UX, and animation mastery.
